## ðŸ’– ðŸ’– ðŸ’– ##

I was contacted by a woman in Brooklyn, NY for tutoring help with some Django tutorial she was working on. It turned out to be a fairly simple problem (but very easy to make) that I could help with after maybe 10 minutes of looking at what she sent me.

I'm no where near a Django expert. I probably wouldn't even qualify as an intermediate. My specialty is teaching Python. But it gave me warm fuzzies to have helped her with her frustrating problem.

She asked "How would I compensate you for your time with me?". Since I only spent about 10 minutes looking at it, I wrote back, *"No need, it was no big deal. Help someone else. It's the Python way. Seriously, the Python community in general is awesome, and you can contribute to the awesomeness.  :-)"*

Honestly I hate the overuse of the word "awesome". It seems like the Battle of the Superlatives out there; everyone trying to attract attention by exaggeration. But this got me thinking about how much the Python community truly **is** awesome. I suppose there are plenty of jerks and losers using Python. But there are a large number of really awesome people in the Python community who go out of their way to help and encourage others.

I love the efforts to make everyone feel welcome, to include everyone and to help people get started and continue in Python. People are so helpful and are willing to volunteer their time and effort to keep the community strong.

I am so grateful to have found a niche that I love and have had so many people help me along the way.

### Thanks! ###

To everyone who helps in the Python community, thank you so much!
