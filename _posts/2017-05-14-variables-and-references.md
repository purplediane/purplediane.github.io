<small><span style="color: #555;"><strong>Note: </strong>I started out writing this material for my students after getting questions about the way strange things sometimes happen with lists in Python. It seemed like it made more sense just to put it in a blog post.</span></small>

Sometimes, it's nice to imagine variables as buckets that contain the data in the variable.  In Python, however, variables aren't really the actual objects (at least not the ones we are interested in), but ***references*** to the objects. Think of the variable as having a rope that is attached to the handle of the bucket, rather than the bucket itself. Each variable has only one rope, but as we will see, buckets can have many ropes attached.

Say you have a variable `x` that is a list; when you do `y = x`, you are just making a **new variable reference** to the same list object that `x` points to. Both `x` and `y` are ropes attached to the handle of the same bucket.

### Mutable vs. Immutable Objects ü§î ###

Lists, dictionaries, and sets are *mutable* objects. That means they can be modified. The basic data types, integers, floats, tuples, and even strings, are all *immutable* data types, and cannot be changed. If you think you are modifying an object of an immutable type, be assured that what really happens is *a new object is created and the variable is changed to reference the new object*. In other words, there is a *new* bucket, and the variable is updated so it's rope is detached from the old bucket and attached to the new bucket.

**Increment vs. Assignment**

The `+=` ("increment") operator behaves differently than the `=` ("assignment") operator when the left-side variable type is mutable (for example, a list). The `+=` operator modifies the underlying object in place, *without changing the reference*. The variable's rope is still attached to the same bucket.

The `=` operator is different. When there is an `=` operator, the *entire* right side of the assignment is evaluated and the result is assigned to the left side, so the variable will reference a *new object*. The rope is detached, and attached to the new bucket.

Let's see some examples:

```python
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = x
>>> x == y
True
>>> x is y
True
>>> id(x)
4315345416
>>> id(y)
4315345416
```

The `id()` function tells you the memory location of the object. You can see here that variables `x` and `y` reference the same object. Now there are two ropes attached to the same bucket. The `is` operator returns True if the objects have the same id.

```python
>>> y += [3, 2, 1]
>>> x == y
True
>>> y is x
True
>>> id(y)
4315345416
>>> x
[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]
>>> y
[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]
```

This is not what most people would expect to happen here; why should `x` change too? Note that the id of `y` did not change with the use of the increment operator. So the change to `y` also affected `x` because no new object is created by the increment operator; the underlying object is modified instead.

Now let's see what happens here:

 ```python
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = x
>>> y is x
True
>>> y = y + [3, 2, 1]
>>> y == x
False
>>> y is x
False
>>> id(y)
4315362824
>>> x
[1, 2, 3]
```

Now `y` and `x` are not equal, nor are they the same according to the "is" operator, because the id of `y` is now different. The use of the assignment operator caused `y` to get a new reference. The rope from `y` is now attached to a different bucket.

```python
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> z = [1, 2, 3]
>>> x == z
True
>>> x is z
False
```

Here, `z` and `x` are equal, but they are not referencing the same object, because they were created separately. **This is why you should never use the "is" operator to check if things are equal**; you will probably get the wrong answer! The only time you should use "is" is when you are comparing to the special singleton variables `None`, `True`, and `False`. They are always in the same location, and any variable that is equal to one of these is referencing the same location.

If you want to make a *copy* of a list so you can manipulate them independently, use the `list` constructor:

```python
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = list(x)
>>> y is x
False
>>> x == y
True
>>> y += [3, 2, 1]
>>> x
[1, 2, 3]
```

In this case, we can increment `y` without affecting `x` because they were never the same object. If you are working with other mutable types, use their constructors to get a copy.

### More Dire Warnings üôÑ ###

Note that this reference issue is not just on lists! I used lists as examples because they are easy to read and understand. Any other mutable data type, including dictionaries and sets will have this issue too if you are not careful.

**You need to be careful when passing mutable objects to functions.** Or rather, **you need to be careful when you are writing functions that accept mutable objects**, because the variables you receive are just references. You don't want to do anything that might modify the objects passed into the function.

Let's see a completely contrived example. Consider this function:

```python
>>> def changeit(sequence):
...     my_vars = sequence
...     my_vars[0] = 1.234
...     # do some other stuff, then end
...
>>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> changeit(nums)
>>> nums
[1.234, 2, 3, 4]
>>>
```

Even though it appears that it is modifying a local copy of the input sequence, it is actually modifying one of the items of the input. It may help you to understand how Python handles references by visualizing what is happening on [Python Tutor][pythontutor]. This is a **great** website for understanding how Python works.

All this brings up another warning: **Do not use mutable objects such as lists or dictionaries as defaults in functions!** Once they get changed, they don't revert back to an empty default. For example, Allen Downey shows a great example of this problem in his book [Think Python][thinkpython], with the problem [Bad Kangaroo - exercise 2 on this page][badkangaroo]. An empty list is used as the default for a parameter to the `__init__` method. This is OK for the first instance created, but the next instance receives the SAME reference value, and therefore the contents of the lists are the same.

### Resources ‚úèÔ∏è

(Edited July 2017) Somehow I hadn't found these excellent videos before writing this blog post. They both expand on the same ideas about the issues of variables, naming, mutability, etc.

A video by Brandon Rhodes from PyOhio 2011: [Names, Objects, and Plummeting From The Cliff][Rhodes]. It's a little dated, but the concepts certainly still apply.

And this video is from PyCon 2015 by Ned Batchelder: [Facts and Myths about Python names and values][py_names]

Here are some StackOverflow questions, as it is a common Python confusion issue, and there are many more:

1. [How to copy a dictionary and only edit the copy][so1]
1. [Function which returns dictionary overwriting all dictionaries][so2]
1. [Original arguments get overwritten][so3]
