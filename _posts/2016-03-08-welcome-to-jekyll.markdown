🎈I'm leaving this here as the first post so I can easily find the info in it.

You don't have to read it.

It doesn't apply to you. ✋

If it did, you would have your own copy of this post in your Jekyll blog.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

I changed this to use different highlighting, rather than the "Liquid" it was originally because colors were lame (Okay, there are still lame, but not as bad):

~~~ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
~~~
