I'd like to introduce you to a cool tool that you can use to manage Python projects, called **[virtualenvwrapper][venvwrapper]**.

You are probably already aware of virtual environments, or "virtualenvs" that allow you to use different versions of Python and Python packages. Last fall, when I was working with Trey Hunner with materials for the Python class he was teaching, I spent some time watching a few Pluralsight Python videos. In one of them, *The Python Developer's Toolkit*, I discovered the existence of **virtualenvwrapper** and was excited to find out how useful it can be.
